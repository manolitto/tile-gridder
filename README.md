Hi.

I'm opening this PR to find a way to communicate to you regarding the ankor-io org on Github (https://github.com/ankor-io). I think you used 
to own ankor.io too? It would be greatly appreciated if you could transfer the anchor-io organziation to me as it maps to our recently new 
ownership of that domain (Github does not allow anything besides "-" in an org name).

Sent an email yesterday to the email on the org page, but I am not sure if that goes to you or not. 

Thoughts?

# Hot to make gridded floors - quick and easy

## About

Quick and easy instructions to make a gridded version of a terrain or floor tile for RPG or wargaming.

## Instructions

As an example I use Devon Jones' [OpenForge Tundra Terrain](https://www.patreon.com/posts/landscapes-iced-63189276).

1. Load your floor tile into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/)
2. Right-click the loaded object and select "Add negative volume / Load ..."
	![Step 1](img/howto-step-1.png)
3. Choose the attached ```grid.negative.6x6.inch.stl``` file
	![Step 2](img/howto-step-2.png)
4. Click on the loaded grid (or select it in the sidebar to the right)
5. Raise it by 8 mm (or whatever is appropriate for your floor tile)
	![Step 3](img/howto-step-3.png)
6. Slice it
	![Step 4](img/howto-step-4.png)
7. Enjoy printing your tile that now has a visible but unobtrusive inch grid
