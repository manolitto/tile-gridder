# Hot to make gridded floors - quick and easy

## About

Quick and easy instructions to make a gridded version of a terrain or floor tile for RPG or wargaming.

## Instructions

As an example I use Devon Jones' [OpenForge Tundra Terrain](https://www.patreon.com/posts/landscapes-iced-63189276).

1. Load your floor tile into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/)
2. Right-click the loaded object and select "Add negative volume / Load ..."

3. Choose the attached ```grid.negative.6x6.inch.stl``` file

4. Click on the loaded grid (or select it in the sidebar to the right)
5. Raise it by 8 mm (or whatever is appropriate for your floor tile)

6. Slice it

7. Enjoy printing your tile that now has a visible but unobtrusive inch grid
